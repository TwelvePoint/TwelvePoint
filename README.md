# About TwelvePoint
TwelvePoint represents the passion we have for films, books, comics, theater and TV series. We wanted to build something that stimulates the creative process and supports those who aspire to become writers (professional and otherwise).

We wanted to create something new, closer to modern user interfaces, a compendium of good practices used to support creativity. A software that would remain reliable and powerful on any device you would carry with you.

Scripts are the skeleton of what we see on TV, in the cinema or on stage. Writing a script requires following several rules, and it's frustrating to see a script rejected just because some spaces on a page are incorrect. Sometimes formatting and the time spent reviewing/correcting a script are the real obstacle to success.

To build a great story there are many things to consider, such as plots, character arcs, development notes… all these details and more must be easily accessible and should not interfere with the creative process.

TwelvePoint is optimized to require minimal effort. The interface is minimalist, designed to fit your writing environment.
You write the story, organize the paragraphs, the software does the rest.

Over time TwelvePoint has been enriched with additional features such as:
- A dedicated environment for self-publishing books.
- EPUB publication.
- Comic script environment.
- Support right-to-left writing system.
  
We hope you will like it and have fun with this new tool as much as we had developing it.
